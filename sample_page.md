## Impact of COVID-19 on school graduation rates

**Project description:** The pandemic has impacted educational activities with several countries shifting to online or hybrid models of education. As a result, students in specific demographic groups (under-represented minorities, low-income students, etc.) are dropping out of high school.

High school dropout rate is defined as the percentage of 16- to 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school credential (either a diploma or an equivalency credential such as a GED certificate) and, as of 2018, this rate varies by race/ethnicity with minorities, including Native Americans and people of color, having higher dropout rates than white youth (Asian at 1.9 percent, White at 4.2 percent, mixed raced at 5.2 percent, Black at 6.4 percent, Hispanic at 8.0 percent, Pacific Islander at 8.1 percent, and American Indian/Alaska Native at 9.5 percent) with males dropping out at higher rates than females for most groups.

if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
